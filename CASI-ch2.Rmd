## Frequentist Inference

Download the kidney data

211 kidney patients have had their _glomerular filtration rates_ measured. `gfr` is an important indicator of kidney function, low values are bad. 

```{r}
kidney_url <- "https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/DATA/kidney.txt"
kidney <- read_delim(kidney_url, 
    " ", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

mean `r xbar = mean(kidney$glr)` and standard error, `r se = sd(kidney$glr)`


```{r}
hist(kidney, col = "green", xlab = "gfr", ylab = "Frequency", breaks = 31, xlim = c(20, 100))
```
